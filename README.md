# Ultra-Low Latency NUMA-Optimized HFT Trading Engine

**NUMA-Aware High-Frequency Trading Engine | C++20 | Nanosecond-Class Performance**

An institutional-grade HFT system engineered for extreme ultra-low latency trading operations with NUMA-aware lock-free data structures, vectorized optimizations, and high-performance parallel processing. This project demonstrates production-ready HFT capabilities with verified sub-microsecond performance metrics.

## NEW: NUMA-Optimized Architecture

**NUMA-Aware Memory**: Lock-free queues with NUMA node affinity and cache-aligned structures  
**Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded order matching with CPU binding and thread pools  
**Lock-Free Data Structures**: Cache-optimized memory pools and atomic operations  
**Vectorized Operations**: SIMD optimizations for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and x86_64  
**Extreme Optimizations**: LTO, loop unrolling, function inlining, and fast-math  
**Memory Efficiency**: Pre-allocated pools with false sharing prevention
